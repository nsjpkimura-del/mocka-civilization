# MoCKA Whitepaper v0.1

## 1. Problem Statement
Modern AI development lacks institutional memory, deterministic governance, and reproducible experiment loops.

## 2. Definition of MoCKA
Deterministic Governance Architecture for Institutional AI Systems.
A reproducible framework that preserves memory, auditability, and experimental continuity.

## 3. Architectural Layers
- Core (Deterministic Governance)
- Knowledge Gate (Institutional Memory)
- Transparency (Public Audit Layer)
- External Brain (Cross-Agent Extension)
- Civilization (Evolutionary Blueprint)

## 4. Institutional Experiment Loop
Hypothesis -> Implementation -> Audit -> Record -> Revision -> Reproducibility Verification

## 5. Long-Term Vision
MoCKA establishes a reproducible civilization model for institutional AI systems.
